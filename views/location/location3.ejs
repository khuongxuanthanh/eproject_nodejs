                                    <b>European Southern Observatory (ESO)</b>, astrophysical organization founded in 1962. Its activities are financially supported
                                    and administered by a consortium of 14 European countries—Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
                                    Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. ESO’s scientific, technical, and
                                    administrative headquarters are in Garching, Germany, near Munich.
                                </p>

                                    ESO operates at three sites in Chile—the La Silla Observatory, located about 600 km (370 miles) north of Santiago at an
                                    altitude of 2,400 metres (7,900 feet), the Very Large Telescope (Paranal Observatory) on Paranal, a 2,600-metre-
                                    (8,600-foot-) high mountain about 130 km (80 miles) south of Antofagasta, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
                                    Array (ALMA) located about 50 km (30 miles) east of San Pedro de Atacama on the Chajnantor plateau at an altitude of 5,000
                                    metres (16,000 feet). The La Silla site has six optical telescopes with diameters as large as 3.6 metres (142 inches). The
                                    Very Large Telescope facility consists of four 8.2-metre (323-inch) and four 1.8-metre (71-inch) supplementary telescopes,
                                    which were designed to be used individually or in combination as a giant interferometer. ALMA is an array of 66 12-metre
                                    (39-foot) radio telescopes.
                                </p>

                                    The instrument is a
                                    3.9-metre (153-inch) reflector that has notably distortion-free optics and an extremely precise computer-controlled
                                    system for pinpointing and tracking celestial objects. The telescope is most useful for viewing distant cosmic objects
                                    of extremely faint luminosity. The Siding Spring Observatory also has the 2.3-metre (91-inch) Advanced Technology
                                    Telescope, which was built in 1984 and was designed to use new telescope technology. There are six other telescopes
                                    at Siding Spring, including the 1.2-metre (48-inch) Schmidt telescope, which is owned and operated by the United
                                    Kingdom Science Research Council. It has been used to extend the sky survey conducted by its sister instrument,
                                    the 1.2-metre (48-inch) Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory, to the southern skies.
