                                    <b>Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories</b>, pair of astronomical observatories in southeast Australia that are
                                    operated by the Australian National University and that together constitute the most important facilities for such
                                    observation in the Southern Hemisphere.
                                </p>

                                    Mount Stromlo Observatory is situated at an elevation of 768 metres (2,520 feet) on Mount Stromlo, 10 km (6 miles)
                                    west of Canberra. It was founded in 1924 as a centre for solar studies but shifted its emphasis in the 1940s to
                                    stellar astronomy. Its main telescope is a 1.9-metre (74-inch) reflector. The Mount Stromlo Observatoryâ€™s viewing
                                    capability was threatened in the 1950s by the lights of the growing city of Canberra, and so a new site was established
                                    at an elevation of 1,165 metres (3,822 feet) on Siding Spring Mountain, about 31 km (19 miles) from Coonabarabran,
                                    New South Wales. On Jan. 18, 2003, a bushfire destroyed all five telescopes at Mount Stromlo. Rebuilding of some of the
                                    facilities began shortly thereafter.

                                    The Siding Spring Observatory was originally a field station for the Mount Stromlo site, but it has become in itself
                                    one of the most important optical observatories in the world. Its main telescope is the Anglo-Australian Telescope,
                                    which was jointly built by Australia and Great Britain and has been operated by them since 1975. The instrument is a
                                    3.9-metre (153-inch) reflector that has notably distortion-free optics and an extremely precise computer-controlled
                                    system for pinpointing and tracking celestial objects. The telescope is most useful for viewing distant cosmic objects
                                    of extremely faint luminosity. The Siding Spring Observatory also has the 2.3-metre (91-inch) Advanced Technology
                                    Telescope, which was built in 1984 and was designed to use new telescope technology. There are six other telescopes
                                    at Siding Spring, including the 1.2-metre (48-inch) Schmidt telescope, which is owned and operated by the United
                                    Kingdom Science Research Council. It has been used to extend the sky survey conducted by its sister instrument,
                                    the 1.2-metre (48-inch) Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory, to the southern skies.
